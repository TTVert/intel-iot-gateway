# Getting Started With Cloud Commander #
<cr>

## Overview ##
Cloud Commander* is a web based file manager with console and editor. Using Cloud Commander, you can work with files, directories and programs via your  browser from any computer, mobile or tablet.  It's a quick and easy way to take an application you've developed locally, upload it to your gateway, and test, edit, iterate directly from the Intel速 IoT Gateway Developer Hub on your IoT Gateway that uses Intel速 IoT Gateway Technology.

## Required Hardware ##
-   IoT Gateway that uses Intel速 IoT Gateway Technology
-   A system running a web browser.  In the case of this tutorial, we used a laptop running Windows 10 and Chrome.

## Assumptions ##
-   Intel速 IoT Gateway Technology version 3.1 or above
-   Cloud Commander is enabled (installed and enabled by default)
-   You have network connectivity to the IoT Gateway and you know it's IP address

## Access Cloud Commander ##
Cloud Commander is all web based and can be easily accessed via the Developer Hub.  To access the Developer Hub, open your web browser and go the <http://ipaddressofthegateway>. Log in with the username and & password.  Once connected, you should see something like this:

To access Cloud Commander, click on the Administration Icon.  You should see a screen like this:

Now click on the LAUNCH button under the Folder icon.  This will open Cloud Commander.  You should now see two sections showing the folder listing on your IoT gateway.  Below the folder listings are a row of buttons (you may need to scroll down). It will look like this:

This is Cloud Commander.  From here you can navigate to any folder or file on your IoT gateway just by clicking on the folder name.  Here are the primary features of Cloud Commander. You can click on these buttons or press the corresponding function key

- F1 Opens a Help screen
- F2 Renames a file
- F3 Views a file
- F4 Edits a file
- F5 Copies a file.  You will be prompted for the location to copy to. By default it will be whatever location you are in on the right side file / folder browser.
- F6 Moves a file.You will be prompted for the location to copy to. By default it will be whatever location you are in on the right side file / folder browser.
- F7 Create a new folder
- F8 Delete a file (you will be prompted to confirm)
- F9 Opens a menu of these options including extras such as Pack and Extract which uses Tar).  You can also open this menu or a subset by right clicking on a file, folder, or blank space.
- F10 Opens a settings menu for Cloud Commander
- >_~ Opens a web based terminal to your IoT gateway.  Very powerful way to quickly execute a command or commands directly on your IoT gateway from the web browser 

To copy files to/from your local system, just drag them to/from the Cloud Commander interface.  You can also right click in Cloud Commander and choose Upload or right click on a file in Cloud Command and choose download.  By right clicking, you'll also see Upload to Cloud or Upload From Cloud.  This is just like coping to/from your local system but supports directly accessing common cloud locations such as Dropbox, Google Drive, Box, and Amazon Cloud.

Let's walk though a typical scenario of using Cloud Commander.

Say you've developed an python application you now want to run from your IoT gateway.  Here's a quick sample.  Save this to a local file on your system and name it hello-world.py

```

	printx "Hello World"
```

Open up Cloud Commander, navigate to your /home/gwuser folder.
Now let's copy the hello-world.py application to you IoT gateway.  Simple drag it from your system to the Cloud Commander view of the /home/gwuser folder.

Now that's it on your IoT gateway, let's try running it.

From Cloud Commander, click on the >_~ button to open a terminal session.  Enter these commands to change to your home folder and run the application

> cd /home/gwuser
> python hellow-world.py

Opps, it looks like there's an error with our code.

Close the terminal session by clicking the X in the top right of the window and from Cloud Commander click on the hello-world.py file and choose or click on the F4 button to edit the file.

Ah, it looks like there's a typo.  Remove the "x" after "print" and click on the X in the top right of the window to close the file and confirm that you want to save your changes.

Now let's try the application again.  From Cloud Commander, click on the >_~ button to open a terminal session.  Enter these commands to change to your home folder and run the application

> cd /home/gwuser
> python hellow-world.py

Much better.  Now the application runs correctly.

**Congratulations! You've successfully used Cloud Commander to upload, edit, and execute an application on the IoT Gateway.**

## Installing an RPM via Cloud Commander ##

- Open Cloud Commander and Navigate to the folder you want to copy the RPM to.  For example; /home/gwuser
- If you have already downloaded the RPM, simply drag the file from your computer to the Cloud Commander interface
- If you have not downloaded the RPM, Cloud Command and download it for you assuming you have the full URL to the RPM.  Select and copy the full URL and then in Cloud Commander right-click and select Upload from Cloud.  Then select Link (URL) and paste the full URL you copied in to the URL of the file field.  Click on the Upload button.
- To install the RPM, click on the >_~ button at bottom of the Cloud Commander window. This will open a console to the IoT Gateway.  Navigate to the folder that contains the RPM.  For example, if you copied it to /home/gwuser you would type the following and press enter/return: 

> cd /home/gwuser

- Now type rpm -Uvh and the rpm name.  For example:

> rpm -Uvh rpmfilename.rpm
  
- The RPM installs
